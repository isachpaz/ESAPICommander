# Available Video Tutorials
Because of the complexity of programming, I find it helpful to follow along with video tutorials sometimes. I have made some Youtube videos to help you get started with features in ESAPIX. Some of them might be a little out of date with a slightly different implementation, but should give you the idea. If you have trouble, just post to the comments and I should be able to help.

## Async Await
Learn how to execute async and await operations in ESAPIX. Normally, you cannot easily do async and await in the Eclipse Scripting API.

## Unit Testing
Learn how to create and test methods using unit tests in ESAPIX. Normally, you cannot easily do unit testing in the Eclipse Scripting API.

## Bootsrapping Your Script
Learn how to get ESAPIX into your application (bootstrapping). This is the first step in getting started with ESAPIX.

> [!NOTE]
> <This video was developed using an earlier version of ESAPIX. It demonstrates the ideas of the IScriptContext interface and basic ideas.>
 For exact current implementations, see [Bootstrapping Plugins](scriptBootstrapping.md) and [Bootstrapping Stand Alone Apps](standAloneBootstrapping.md)
